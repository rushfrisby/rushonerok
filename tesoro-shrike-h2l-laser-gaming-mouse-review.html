<p>I recently bought a <a href="http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-shrike-h2l-laser-gaming-mouse.html">Max Tesoro Shrike H2L Laser Gaming Mouse</a>. Here are my thoughts on it so far.</p>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

<ol>
<li>The laser sensor is precise.  </li>
<li>I was concerned about the mouse cord before my purchase because I have been using a wireless mouse for the past 10 years and have become accustomed to the freedom. The cord is very thin, lightweight, and long. I haven’t noticed it’s there unless I look at it.  </li>
<li>The scroll wheel is stiff which I like. It makes it easier to use the scroll wheel as a button. I use it as a button when gaming since there isn’t a lot of travel between the left click button and the scroll wheel and most games use the scroll wheel anyways (ex: for cycling through items). It’s the bump/stop scroller type which I like as well, not free-wheel.  </li>
<li>The weight system is a nice option. I loaded mine up with all of the weights (35 grams). The weights come in a plastic case if you don’t use all of them and want to store the rest.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<ol>
<li>The amount of travel when clicking is too much for a gaming mouse. The $5 Logitech mouse I have at work has less travel. This isn’t acceptable for gaming. It’s only okay for daily computer activities.  </li>
<li>The top side looks like it is brushed aluminium in pictures but it is actually plastic that is painted to look like brushed aluminium. After enough use I’m sure the paint will wear off and make the mouse look raggedy.  </li>
<li>The DPI button is clear plastic and there is clear plastic leading up to it which contains an “adjustable full color LED control” under it. There are a number of things wrong with this: - The clear plastic is tinted so you don’t get much light coming through it.  </li>
<li>It seems like the light is made up of a 3 or 4 LEDs – Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow. They should have just gone with a single (or a few) adjustable-color LED because combining the 4 colors together isn’t producing a nice light effect. If you look closely you can see the different LED colors. If you change the color using the software the lights recalibrate by cycling through each color.</li>
<li>The clear plastic is on top of the mouse… you know… where you hand is covering it most of the time. It would make more sense if other parts of the mouse were transparent instead.</li>
<li>Overall I think they could have removed the LED feature and reduced the cost.</li>
<li>The upper portion of the thumb grip needs to come out a little more so that the mouse is easier to pick up. I have been using the underside of the thumb buttons to help pick up the mouse. This could lead to fatigue and accidental thumb button clicks.  </li>
<li>The packaging was not nice. It was suspended it a plastic shell inside of a cardboard box. Seems like it was made to hang on a rack at BestBuy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="otherthoughts">Other thoughts</h3>

<ol>
<li>The bump on the backside of the mouse is a little high but it hasn’t bothered me much.  </li>
<li>I wish the thumb grip came out wide so I could rest my thumb on it instead of actually having to grip. This is nice for casual use. (like the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/performance-mouse-mx">Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a>)  </li>
<li>I wish the DPI button did not say “DPI” on it and that adjusting the DPI was a software only feature. You can remap this button using the software but the button still says “DPI” on it.  </li>
<li>Mouse must be plugged into your USB host port that provide 500 mA (Milliamps) at 5 V (Volts) – this means you cannot plug it into the USB port on the <a href="/blog/max-keyboard-nighthawk-x8-review">Nighthawk X8 keyboard which I also bought</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I do not think this is a great gaming mouse. It works well for daily usage and may work well for designers. I’m concerned about how long it will last. I plan on keeping it for now since these things are costly, but I will be looking at alternatives not too far in the future.</p>
